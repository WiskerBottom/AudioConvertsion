# AudioConvertsion
A simple program to help convert .webm files to .mp3
When prompted for a directory enter where the music files are stored, enter the path from /home/, for example /home/charles/Music/. Please also include the trailing slash. After the program finishes it should close itself out. It doesn't delete the old .webm files but a simple 'rm *.webm' should work to do that.
